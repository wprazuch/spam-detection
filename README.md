# spam-detection

## Introduction

This repository contains a workflow for constructing a Deep Learning model dedicated for spam detection. 
During project, some problem analysis and experiments were taken to evaluate, how SMS spam is different from
Mail spam and how it is affecting the spam detection model. 

## Data

Datasets for this mini-project were taken from [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) and
[Spam Mails Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/venky73/spam-mails-dataset).

## Methods

This could be interpreted a real-world scenario of applying Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence data. As a comparison,
a 1D Convolutional layers were also used.

## Stack

In the project, Tensorflow together with high-level abstractions written in Keras were used. As Keras makes it very convenient
to quickly build NLP solutions, some handy out-of-the-box tools were used. However, a standard step-by-step approach for
data preparation & preprocessing were used to show how it's done.
